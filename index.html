            <section class="about"><h5>ABOUT <span>ME</span></h5>
                <p>I'm obsessed with making things and even more obsessed with making things better. I've  been in the business of creating since i hung my first painting on the fridge when i was three. After graduating from Parklands High School, i've been actively involved in the web design and devlopment community for the last 1 year. I've designed churches websites and individuals' blog website. </p>
                <p>My specialty is front-end web design and devoelopment, making beautiful and attractive webpages. My interests however extend beyond the web and love helping people with marketing strategy.</p>
                <p>When i'm not designing and developing websites, I'm probably hanging out with my family members, watching basketball and football, playing playstation games or messing around with something inspired by Steve Jobs.</p>
